# Simple Server

Simple Server allows you to easily get a node.js static file server up and running anywhere anytime.


## Installing


1. [Install Node.js](https://github.com/balupton/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js)

1. Install CoffeeScript
		
		npm -g install coffee-script

1. Install Simple Server

		npm -g install simple-server


## Using

To get your `public` folder up and running on `http://localhost:3000` simply type the following into terminal:

``` bash
simple-server public 3000
```

The first argument is the folder you want to serve, and the second argument is the port to serve from :)
